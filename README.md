# Our Pod
  Our pod is an organization and scheduling application for families who have created "pods" during the COVID pandemic.
Users can create an account and then either A) Create a new pod, or B) Join an existing pod. When creating a new pod, users
will generate a Key Code, which they will give to other users so that they can join the created pod. The user creating the pod will 
also name the pod so that members can verify they are joining the correct pod. Users will then enter all of their contact
information for other pod members to see. The user can then go to their pod page and see the contact information for all of the 
members of their pod. There is also a table with a list of dates where users can volunteer to host the other children in their 
pod for the listed date. Administrators (users who created their pod) have the ability to add and remove dates to the calender table 
and remove members from their pod.
